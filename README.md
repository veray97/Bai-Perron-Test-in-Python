# Bai-Perron-Test-in-Python
I found there is no clear/step-by-step example of how to do Bai Perron test in Python. (There is packages in R and Stata)

This repository provides an exmaple of using Bai-Perron method([Bai and Perron(2003)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.659)) on PCE data in Python. The [related data](https://journaldata.zbw.eu/dataset/computation-and-analysis-of-multiple-structural-change-models) of the paper can also be accessed as reference.

The benefit of structural point test is that we can train different model in different periods, which will give a better modeling than the regression over the whole interval.
