# Bai-Perron-Test-in-Python
I found there is no clear/step-by-step example of how to do Bai Perron test in Python. (There is packages in R and Stata)

So I want to provide an example of the Bai-Perron test in Python and also use this repository to document my learning process of the algorithm.

The data used here is monthly PCE index.(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCE)
